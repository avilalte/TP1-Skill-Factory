**Skill Factory - First Project.** HTML - CSS - Javascript.

The goal was to create a site with 3 pages which would contain in no specific order: a contact form, a users table, and a set of cards displaying information about Rick and Morty characters.

For the last two pages the data was fetched from different APIs using **Axios**. Styles were applied using vanilla **CSS**.
